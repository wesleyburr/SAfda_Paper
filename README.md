# Modelling particle number size distribution: A continuous approach

Imputation and analysis of data for the paper entitled "Modelling particle number size distribution: A continuous approach". 

## Source Data

(some stuff from Anja)

## Imputation

The imputation of the time series (51 in total) contained in the original source data is done using the `tsinterp` package, which implements the algorithm first developed in

## SAfda

(some notes about the package)

## Analysis

(a guide to the analysis pathway, maybe a reference to a vignette)
